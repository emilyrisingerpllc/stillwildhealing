## The Forest is Waiting

Weave your values back into your life, strengthen your inner being with the outward facing self. Claim your divine right to
establish a relationship with the more-than-human world. 

Confront your environmental fears with support and confidence. Cultivate joy by learning to hold space for your fears while
engaging with the natural world-the world you belong in. 

I am a Certified Nature and Forest Therapist through the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy. I offer space for you to
rekindle or to newly forge your relationship with nature utilizing sensory engagement to explore and emerge to your truest self.
